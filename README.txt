About:
    This is a simple solidity contract that stores and recives different values and objects.
    Two types of blockchains are used for deployment in this project using Brownie.
    1) Ganache-Cli
    2) Rinkeby Testnet
    This was done using Brownie in Python. Brownie can be used to either deploy contracts to a Native Ganache-Cli Network or a custom network that can chosen from Brownie's network list
Purpose:
    The purpose of this project was to get an understanding of brownie and how it can be used to easily deploy contracts to any chain.
    Unlike web3.py where we had to create contract, sign and send transactions individually, Brownie takes care of all that in one line and creates a list of contract deployments that can be later used.
